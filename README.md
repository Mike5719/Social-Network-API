# Social-Network-API

## Description:

In this challenge we have been asked to build an API social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friend's thoughts, and create a friend list. This was accomplished using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and Mongoose ODM.

## Installation:

The user will be required to install the following dependencies by typing NPM i in the console.

        "express": "^4.17.1",
        "moment": "^2.30.1",
        "mongoose": "^7.0.2"

## Usage:

Once the dependencies have been installed on the user's computer, the user will need to start the application by typing NPM start in the console. The user can then navigate to the Insomnia tool to use the application.
